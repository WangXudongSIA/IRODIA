## Our work 

Battlefield environments are harsher than normal environments, and the images captured by imaging equipment are more prone to degradation. Degraded images seriously affect the analysis of military intelligence and the deployment of intelligent weapons. To address this issue, we propose an image recovery algorithm, which recovers degraded battlefield images based on a physical imaging model and uses a light-weight network to estimate the parameters of physical model. In addition, we propose a strategy to joint training of the image recovery module and the object detection module. Specifically, we integrate the recovery module to the front of YOLO detector to jointly optimize the two modules with detection loss. The image recovery module is lightweight without significant adverse impact on the real-time running of object detection, which can be easily deployed to intelligent unmanned devices such as battlefield robots. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better recovery performance in battlefield environments, and the joint training strategy effectively improve the
accuracy of object detection.
